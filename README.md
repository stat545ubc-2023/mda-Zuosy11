# STAT 545A Mini Data-Analysis

Author: *Shengyu Zuo*

## *Project description*

This is the Mini Data Analysis Project from STAT 545A. The dataset is from 'datateachr' package by Hayley Boyce and Jordan Bourak. This project uses the 'parking_meters' acquired courtesy of The City of Vancouver's Open Data Portal. It currently has 10032 rows and 22 columns. More info available at: <https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/parking-meters/information/>.

Currently (for Milestone 2), my research questions for this project are:

1.  Are there specific regions within the city that have distinct patterns of time limits, and how do these patterns affect parking rates? Do areas with shorter time limits tend to have lower parking rates, and vice versa? I would like to explore the distribution and relationship of parking rates and time limits in different areas within the city.
2.  Does the acceptance of credit card relate to parking rates? I would like to explore whether the payment method will affect the rates.
